# CSE 1322L - Module 7B

## Coding Assignment

For the problem statements below, you must write the Pseudocode for each part of the solution. The Pseudocode must be complete and following the standards listed on the FYE website.

After completing the pseudocode, please use it to create the source code in your lab's specific language (either C# or Java). Make sure to turn in both the pseudocode and source code to Gradescope and in their appropriate drop boxes. The pseudocode will be turned into assignment 4A and the source code to 4B.

### Problem Statement

Write an application that uses a bubble sort to sort an array of 10000 integers in the traditional way.  Write another application that uses parallelism to sort the same array 10000 integers.  Display the time it takes for each application to run (you will have to figure out how many decimal places to show in order for it to display properly).  Remember that the same array should be used as a starting point for each method of sorting.

### Start writing the code from your pseudocode

Code the solution from your pseudocode. Compile and debug all parts of your program to ensure it is correct.  

### Test

Test your code with sample data.

Now make sure that your code is the best it can be.  Check your formatting, comments, and make sure your output is correct and communicates what is happening in your code.

### What to Turn In
