## CSSE 1322L Module 2 Assignment 

# Assignment 2A and 2B

For the problem statement below, you must write the pseudocode and the source code for each assignment. The pseudocode must be complete and following the standards listed at https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/pseudocode/pseudocodeguide.php

## Problem Statement

Write an abstract class called `Vacation` that includes three class variables named: `cost`, `budget` and `destination`. It has an abstract method, `keptToBudget`, returning how much the vacation is over or under budget using `cost`.

This class has two non-abstract subclasses, each with their own class variables:

* All-Inclusive Vacation:**
    * brand (such as ClubMed, Delta Vacations, etc.)
    * rating (number of stars)
    * total cost (all-inclusive means that there is one price for all expenses on the trip).

* Piecemeal Vacation:
    * list of expenses (hotel, meal, airfare, etc.).
    * list of corresponding costs (hotel cost, meal cost, airfare cost, etc.).

(Both of these class variables must be an array, or similar data structure.)

Lastly, create a test class that will create 2 *All-Inclusive Vacation* and 2 *Piecemeal Vacation* objects inside of a main method. Also create 2 `Vacation` objects that are set to 1 *All-Inclusive Vacation* and 1 *Piecemeal Vacation* object. You may have user input for their object variables or you may hardcode the values. Ensure that you print each object's values to the console along with the return value of the `keptToBudget` method.

## Part A - Break the problem down and write the pseudocode

Break the problem statement into parts to fully understand what is expected as input, output and processes in your code. Write down all the variables you will need from the problem statement. Once you have broken down the problem, start writing your pseudocode.

Writing the pseudocode may take a while and several iterations to fully get the solution complete. Walk through the problem and your pseudocode as if the program is running and you are the user. Make sure your input prompts and output messages are clear.

Now make sure that your code is the best it can be. Check your formatting, prompts to the user, and make sure they are clear and help the user interact with your code in an easy manner.

*Finally, turn in your pseudocode to the assignment 2A dropbox on Gradescope.*

*The source code will be due the following week, so wait to receive feedback on the pseudocode before proceeding on this assignment.*

### Review your pseudocode:

After turning in your pseudocode, you will receive some feedback and a grade. Make sure that you correct any logical errors before beginning to write your source code.

## Part B - Start writing the code from your pseudocode

Code the solution from your pseudocode in part A. Compile and debug all parts of your program to ensure it is correct.

Now make sure that your code is the best it can be. Check formatting, prompts to the user, and make sure they are clear and help the user interact with your code in an easy manner.

### Test

Test your code with at least two sets of input.

Now make sure that your code is the best it can be.Â  Check your formatting, prompts to the user, and make sure they are clear and help the user interact with your code in an easy manner.

*Finally, turn in your source code to the assignment 2B dropbox on Gradescope.*
