# CSE 1322L -- Lab 2A -- OOP/Inheritance

_This lab may contain intentional minor errors; they should be reasonably easy to find and exist so that you must think as you go through the lab.  Like many things in life, "trust but verify."  Ideas will always be correct; only minor code and syntax may be incorrect._

## Lab 2A: Object Oriented Programming & Inheritance

### Objectives

To write a program using classes to demonstrate how inheritance is implemented using code.

### Problem Statement

Person, Student, Employee, Faculty and Staff classes

Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Define a class named MyDate that contains the fields year, month and day. A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the method in each class that displays the objects' data to also include the class name and the person's name.  

Write a test program that creates at least one Person, Student, Employee, Faculty and Staff object and displays all the data in each object.
