# Module 6B - Coding Assignment

For the problem statements below, you must write the Pseudocode for each part of the solution. The Pseudocode must be complete and following the standards listed on the FYE website.

After completing the pseudocode, please use it to create the source code in your lab's specific language (either C# or Java). Make sure to turn in both the pseudocode and source code to Gradescope and in their appropriate drop boxes. The pseudocode will be turned into assignment 4A and the source code to 4B.

### Problem Statement:
Write a program that reads every line in a text file, line by line. Obtain the name of the existing file and the name of the new (copy) of the file by prompting the user for both of these on the console.  Make sure that the original file exists and can be read.  If not, display a warning message and allow the user to either abort the program or enter a new file name.  If the name of the new file to copy the text into already exists, then display a warning message and ask the user if they wish to overwrite the existing file or change the file name.  If they wish to give a new name, then go through the same procedure as you did with the first name.  

After you have copied the file successfully, you should display to the user the name of the original file that was copied and the name of the file it was copied to successfully.

(A sample file “textfile.txt” has been included along with this assignment in the dropbox to assist you in your programming) 
 

### Start writing the code from your pseudocode:
Code the solution from your pseudocode. Compile and debug all parts of your program to ensure it is correct.  

### Test
Test your code with sample data.

Now make sure that your code is the best it can be.  Check your formatting, comments, and make sure your output is correct and communicates what is happening in your code.

### What to Turn In
