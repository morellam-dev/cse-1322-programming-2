# CSE 1322L - Java Lab 6B - File I/O

## Lab 6B: File I/O

### Objectives

To write a program applying the concepts of file input /output.

### Problem Statement

Write an application that implements a simple text editor.  Use a text field and a button to get the file.  Read the entire file as characters and display it in a `TextArea`.  The user will then be able to make changes in the text area. Use a "Save" button to get the contents of the text area and write that over the text in the original file.

Hint: Read each line from the file and then display the line in the text area using a method, maybe called `appendText(aString)`.  A method, maybe called `getText`, will return all of the text area in a string that then can be written to the file.
