# CSE 1322 – Lab 4B – Recursion

_This lab may contain intentional minor errors; they should be reasonably easy to find and exist so that you must think as you go through the lab.  Like many things in life, "trust but verify."  Ideas will always be correct; only minor code and syntax may be incorrect._

## Lab 4B: Recursion

### Objectives

To write a program using classes to demonstrate how recursion is implemented using code.

### Problem Statement

Write a recursive method to check whether a string is a palindrome.  (A palindrome is a string that reads the same both forward and backward.  For example, the string “madam” is a palindrome.) Your test program must contain the value – returning recursive method that returns true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise.  Use appropriate parameters in your recursive method.
