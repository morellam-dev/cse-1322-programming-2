# CSE 1322L – Java Lab 3B – GUI and Strings

_This lab may contain intentional minor errors; they should be reasonably easy to find and exist so that you must think as you go through the lab.  Like many things in life, "trust but verify."  Ideas will always be correct; only minor code and syntax may be incorrect._

## Lab 3B: GUI and Strings

### Objectives

To write a program illustrating how to process strings from a GUI interface.

### Problem Statement

Write a program that displays a window with two text fields, a click button and a label. The program should allow your user to enter a number (entered as text) in each of the text fields, then click the button to add the two numbers; finally displaying the sum in your label.

### What to Turn In

Please include the text files you used for your program in your submission so the instructor can run the program easily.
