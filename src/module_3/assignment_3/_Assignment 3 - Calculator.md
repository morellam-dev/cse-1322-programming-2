# CSE 1322L - Module 3B

## Coding Assignment

For the problem statement below, you must review the Pseudocode for each part of the solution.  You will then write your code based on the feedback from your Pseudocode assignment.

### Problem Statement

Create a application that acts as a simple calculator.  Create buttons for 0-9 and a text field that displays the concatenation of the current digits as they are clicked.  Add buttons for operators “+”, “-“, “*”, and “/”.  Add a final button for “=” that calculates the computed value with the value entered in the text field.  For instance, clicking buttons 7, +, 8, =  one-by-one, then it should display 15.  

### Start writing the code from your pseudocode

Check your formatting, comments, and make sure your output is correct and communicates what is happening in your code.
