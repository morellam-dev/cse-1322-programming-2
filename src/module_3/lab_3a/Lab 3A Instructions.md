# CSE 1322L -- Lab 3A -- GUI

_This lab may contain intentional minor errors; they should be reasonably easy to find and exist so that you must think as you go through the lab.  Like many things in life, "trust but verify."  Ideas will always be correct; only minor code and syntax may be incorrect._

## Lab 3A: GUI

### Objectives

To write a program that illustrates how to code a box with buttons on the screen and to create an event class to handle the click of a button.

### Problem Statement

Write a program using a layout manager.  You must write the program to meet the following criteria: 
* Create a window with a layout. 
* Add 6 buttons to the window, each with a number to identify it – such as Button1, Button2, Button3, Button4, Button5, Button6.  
* When a button is clicked, it will create an event object.
* Create a listener object that will respond to the event object by displaying a message to the screen stating which button was clicked.

Hint: Make a separate class to handle the event (clicking the button).


### What to Turn In
Please include the text files you used for your program in your submission so the instructor can run the program easily.
